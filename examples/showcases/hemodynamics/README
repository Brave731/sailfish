There are three sample geometries, available as compressed .stl files in the
geo/ subdirectory:
 - ushape.stl -- artificially generated bent pipe
 - basilar.stl -- fragment of the basilar artery
 - c0006.stl -- fragment of the internal carotid artery

The latter two are modified meshes from the Aneurisk database.

The original orientation of the meshes is:
- basilar
 . dimensions by descending length of bounding box edges: X, Y, Z
 . inflow at y = min
 . outflows at: x = min (2), x = max (2)

- c0006
 . dimensions by descending length of bounding box edges: Y, Z, X
 . inflow at y = min
 . outflow at x = max

- ushape
 . dimensions by descending length of bounding box edges: Z, Y, X
 . inflow, outflow at z = min

In order to prepare the geometries for use, you need to run the process_geometry.py
script, e.g.:

python process_geometry.py geo/ushape_402_0.0025 geo/proc_ushape_402 zxy 200000

The profiles directory contains velocity profiles extracted from FIXME:

 - ica_ford_profile.orig: original file with two cycles
 - ica_ford_profile.dat: single cycle extracted out of the orig file
 - ica_ford_profile_uniform_lin_int.dat: single cycle, with data points resampled
   with a constant time step (using linear interpolation between original data
   points)
