- Regularized boundary conditions for 2D and 3D.

- Incompressible LBM model.

- BC node direction detection in 3D.
  Add node direction detection for 3D geometries, thus fixing the
  BC and equilibrium boundary conditions in 3D.

- Add unit tests for 2D geometry.
  The unit tests currently only cover the 3D geometry.  Add similar
  tests for 2D.

- Implement the single-grid access pattern.
  Instead of alternating between two distinct grids, the LBM can be
  implemented so that only a single grid is used (at an increased
  computational cost of the kernel).  Implement and test this access
  pattern for all grids.

- Use the Poiseuille geometry to test velocity BCs.
  By transforming the standard force-driven test case into a moving
  frame of reference, the test case can be redefined so that wall
  nodes are replaced by velocity boundary conditions.  Implement this
  for the 2D and 3D test cases and add this to the Poiseuille regtest.

- Add a Taylor-Green testcase.
  See e.g. the D3Q13 PRE paper for more info about this test case.

- Add multi-GPU support / domain decomposition.
  Make it possible to automatically/manually divide the simulation
  domain into subdomains which are simulated on separate GPUs.

- Implement grid refinement.
  Make it possible to define regions of the simulation domain which are
  to be simulated at a higher spatial and temporal resolution.
