A quick'n'dirty hack that makes it possible to use the OpenGL-based Sailfish
visualization modules remotely over NX

To use:

1) build the module:
   $ python setup.py build

2) update your PYTHONPATH:
   $ export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6"

   (you will need to adjust the value depending on your system's architecture
    and Python version; just run `ls build/lib*` to see what the correct path is)
