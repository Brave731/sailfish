1. Purpose of the project.
--------------------------
This repository currently contains the results of my experiments with
running Lattice Boltzmann solvers on the GPU.  The code isn't necessarily
optimal or even correct in all cases.  It currently provides an
interesting toy to play with and a practical illustration of the
implementation of the LBM using CUDA.  It is my hope that at some
point the project will be advanced enough to be used in some
practical applications.

Patches and other contributions are welcome.  If you plan to extend
this code with a non-trivial feature, please contact me before you
start implementing it, as I sometimes change the structure and
organization of the existing code (there, I warned you -- this is
all still experimental, remember?)

If you want to help out, have a look at the TODO -- it should provide
a good starting point and give you some ideas about what remains
to be done.


2. Running the examples.
------------------------
Requirements:
 - pygame-1.8.1
 - pytables-2.1.1
 - numpy
 - mako-0.2.5
   - for the CUDA backend: pycuda-0.92, nvidia-drivers, nvidia-cuda-toolkit
   - for the OpenCL backend: pyopencl, any OpenCL implementation
 - matplotlib (for regtests)

No installation is necessary, just run any of the executable .py files.
Use the --help command line option to learn about parameters adjustable
from the command line.

Currently supported visualization modes: rgb1, std, hsv.
Currently supported LB models: bgk, mrt.

Keyboard control during the simulation:
- 0: visualize absolute fluid velocity
- 1: visualize absolute x component of fluid velocity
- 2: visualize absolute y component of fluid velocity
- 3: visualize the fluid density
- v: toggle the visualization of the velocity vector field
- t: toggle the visualization of the fluid tracer particles
- r: reset the simulation geometry
- q: quit the program
- s: take a screenshot

During the simulation, you can also use the mouse to place obstacles
anywhere in the simulation domain.
